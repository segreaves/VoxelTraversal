Voxel traversal in 2D. This is an implementation of a grid class that can return the cells that are intersected by a ray.
The ray can originate inside as well as outside of the grid. And the function that returns the intersected cells allows for a maximum traversal element to be specified. This way the algorithm will stop early once the maximum distance has been travesrsed.
This is a class that supports functionality for the Space Invaders project (https://github.com/segreaves/SpaceInvaders)
